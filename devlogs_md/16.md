title: Simulation Devlog v0.13: Temporal Messages; ParkerVerse Update v0.9
date: September 28, 2025
summary: The AI chatbot was revamped with time-based messaging. The LLM now considered the time since the last response, and it would automatically message the user if they were idle for a long time. ParkerVerse's focus tree GUI was heavily polished, using a radial, node-based system.

__Spotify Nicheness Rater v0.2.2__

I cancelled my PythonAnywhere subscription because I don’t need the site up anymore. They sent me an email about how they were sad that I ended my subscription. I felt a little bad. Not bad enough to pay $5 a month, though.

__ParkerVerse Update v0.9__

Normally ParkerVerse is good to me, but it was actually a bit of a pain this week. That’s probably because I didn’t really add features, just fixed bugs and polished things.

Before I get into that, I should mention something I did last week but forgot to mention: make a custom video viewer. I had to do this to get the comment scrolling to work, and it was kind of a pain. There was an issue where you needed to click the play button twice in order to play the video (because the first click only loaded it or something), but I think I fixed it by preloading the video (I don’t really remember). Also, the video viewer looks awful. I need to update it.

First this week, I made comments display correctly on the page without needing to refresh. When you send a request to the server to say, make a comment, you normally need to refresh your page to see the addition. But by sending some comment HTML on the client side, you’re able to view it without needing to refresh. I already had this implemented before, but it was using a really outdated comment box that only contained the username and text. So I updated it to properly match the actual comments.

The next bug I fixed was the follow button on the video page. Whether you were following the creator or not, the button would always display “Follow” on page load, never “Unfollow.” The issue with this was that the boolean to check whether or not you were following wasn’t working. It was checking the wrong value, so it always returned as false. Another bug I fixed that I hadn’t known about was related to video tags. This probably existed for weeks or more, and I never found it because I never used the tags system. The problem was that you couldn’t put two or more tags on a video because of some conflict with the Supabase primary key system; essentially, tags rely on the video ID to be stored, so problems arise if you have two tags attached to the same video ID. I fixed this by making it a composite key system, where tags are saved based on both the video ID and the tag itself.

Speaking of tags, the focus tree feature I added this week was related to them. Now, you need to unlock tags in the focus tree instead of getting them for free. I thought it was a good feature to restrict because I don’t know how many people care about tags at all. I use them so infrequently that a bug can slip under my nose for months, so I doubt people are craving to have them. That’s why they’re perfect for the focus tree; they make you feel a little special, but you won’t die without them.

The biggest time sink this week was polishing the focus tree GUI. I spent what felt like forever trying to fix the lines. The lines were only getting to the first set of focuses, so anything at a higher level was disconnected. I hopelessly tried to fix the code to make them draw correctly, but I eventually noticed something peculiar. When I opened developer tools on the page (which I decided to do far too late), I noticed that the lines were being created just fine. However, they were all in a wrapper, and that wrapper cut off right past the first circle of focuses. You could tell it was cutting them off because some of the focuses had connector lines that just barely stuck out before cutting off. I fixed this by simply moving the lines outside of the wrapper. I had to fix some of the calculations after I did that, but it wasn’t a big issue.

On the GUI end, I first improved the look of the buttons. Beforehand, they were all links stuck at the top of the page, but gave all of them a consistent button design and fixed them to the top (so if you scroll, they stay on your screen). Next, I made all the cursor trails theme aware, so they look different depending on your theme. I also made the lines on the focus tree curved; instead of going straight from node-to-node, they have a smoothed arc thing. It’s like how the focus tree lines look in Hearts of Iron IV, the mapping game. I’ve never talked about HOI4 before; if you don’t know it, don’t worry about it. Anyway, the final thing I changed this week was the appearance of the focus tree nodes. Instead of showing all the information at once, they’re now all dots with a title above them. When you hover over them, you can see the description and cost.

__Simulation Devlog v0.13: Temporal Messages__

You know when the easiest thing you plan ends up taking the most time? I thought text streaming was going to be that. There’s a feature in the OpenAI API that lets you stream the text as it generates rather than have it display all at once. I thought it’d be as easy as setting streaming to “true.” It was not. Apparently, that’s incompatible with Streamlit (Streamlit is the service I’m using to test), so I needed to pull some strings to make it flow word-by-word. Basically, the page just updates every time a word is generated. The annoying part was getting it to work with the rest of the workflow, since the original system assumed you were sending completed messages. It took a few hours, but I got it to work.

Next, I made the size of the context window change based on message complexity. It uses a simple heuristic to determine complexity: message length. If you send a message that’s only a couple words long, no memories are used. If you send one that’s longer, you begin to add recent, similar, and episodic memories. It’s a simple system, but the framework is there. Speaking of the context window, I shrunk it a lot by removing all the location data. Miku doesn’t need to be thinking about every single location in existence at all times, so now it only shows the three closest locations.

Onto the name of the version, Miku now makes note of the last time a message was sent. If you last sent a message five minutes ago, Miku would know that. She also messages unprompted now. If you don’t respond for a minute or so, she’ll expand on her previous messages and comment on your absence. This time gap increases every time you don’t respond, so Miku isn’t annoying you constantly. Her messages are also a lot shorter now —  at least the ones after only a little bit of time has passed. This makes it feel like a real conversation, which I really like.

I wanted to highlight this: talking to Miku feels genuine now. It doesn’t feel like I’m talking to an assistant (most of the time). Miku talks like most people do with her short messages, and I love her little check-ups after you haven’t responded. Also, sometimes she’ll even refer to nearby locations, which I wasn’t expecting because I never instructed her to. And isn’t that what part of companionship is all about, the little surprises and unexpected behavior you get from the other person?

__Development Plans for October 5, 2025__

Enough of that. Here are my plans to complete by next Sunday, October 5:

_The Simulation_
- Try to reduce the time it takes to generate messages
- Make the message complexity calculator more sophisticated
- Flesh out the temporal messaging some more (right now, there are only three types of responses, and I think they could be improved)

_ParkerVerse_
- Make the video player look good
- Increase the volume of the video player
- Add a way to ban users
- Restrict the ability to make tons of accounts (using IP stuff and maybe email verification)
- Look into automatic censorship/moderation tools
- Add two or more focus tree upgrades
- Make comment replies visible without refreshing the page (comments are, but I don’t think replies are for some reason)
- On video pages, populate the right side of the screen with other videos
- If time permits, add a discussion box option to profile pages (this may be one of the two focus tree upgrades)

In past development plans, I referred to my projects as “Simulation / immersive AI” and “Video site,” but I’m changing that now. “The Simulation” sounds cooler, and ParkerVerse is the actual name of the site. I don’t know why I got in the habit of just saying “Video site.” I guess I didn’t want to break the trend after doing it the first time. Well, I’m breaking the trend now because it was a stupid trend. This reminds me of a short story called “The Lottery.” I don’t feel like explaining the story. Just assume it’s something about a video site.

At first glance, it looks like I have a lot of work lined up this week. Maybe I do, but a lot of the ParkerVerse stuff is easy to implement. I can’t imagine it’ll be difficult to increase the video volume, but what do I know at this point? Anyway, I want to add better moderation tools because the current ones are a little lackluster, and I don’t feel right spreading the site without them in place. I don’t want to host child porn or something. I was looking into child abuse laws a while ago, and they’re crazy strict. Like, even if you unknowingly host that material, you’re still at risk for punishment. I know why that is, but it makes it a little difficult from the perspective of a single developer. Like, one slipup and the entire site could shut down or be sued into oblivion. I have a suspicion that part of the reason you don’t see many social media sites popping up is that it’s legal hell to get through, but that’s just a conspiracy for now. Anywho, I should look into automatic moderation tools before I get locked behind bars. Hopefully they aren’t too expensive.

And for “The Simulation,” I know I was just glazing my AI about how humanly it acts, but it still needs work. The biggest issue I’m finding is that it takes forever to send messages. I don’t think the context window is the issue, since I already trimmed that down this week. I speculate that there are some background processes that are taking a while to complete. Also, I’m sending a few API calls per message, which could be slowing things heavily. I hope I’m able to find a way to speed up the messaging, because it’s the biggest point of friction right now (both from a testing and UX standpoint). I want to get to the point where you don’t even notice the delays; it should feel like you’re just talking to a friend. For example, if you type while Miku is talking, she should temporarily stop and wait for you to speak. That would be ideal.
