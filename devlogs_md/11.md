title: Simulation Devlog v0.9: Episodic and Underground Memory; ParkerVerse Update v0.5
date: August 24, 2025
summary: Episodic memory (summaries of past conversations) and underground memory (daily reflections) were added as well as a personality trait system for the AI. Now named ParkerVerse, the video site saw a key implementation: a skill tree where users unlock site features and customizations. The timer app also had an overhaul, now displaying graphs of your desktop activity.

__Simulation Devlog v0.9: Episodic and Underground Memory__

Every time I write one of these devlogs, I have to go back and look up what the last version number was.

This week, I pretty much did exactly what I said I was going to do. I added episodic memory, although it doesn’t save based on the day; instead, it’s sort of hierarchical, where it summarizes messages in a fixed quantity. Every 10 messages, it’ll summarize the last 10 into a short paragraph. Then, when you get 10 of those summaries, it generates another summary that condenses all the information from each of those. You’re basically burying old messages under layers of abstraction, which gives the chatbot a better idea of what’s going on. Right now, these summaries are pumped into the context window, and the limit is 5 summaries, but I plan on changing that. It’s kind of useless to have the recursive memory structure only to take the 5 most recent summaries. I might make it generate summaries less frequently, too — maybe one every 20 messages. I don’t want to flood the chatbot with a bunch of old stuff. Also, I might make a hybrid system where all the summaries are condensed at the end of the day into a daily summary. This helps the AI understand the flow of time better.

I also added “underground” memory, which is sort of similar to episodic memory. Every night, the chatbot writes a reflection on the previous day. This isn’t visible to the user; it’s meant to simulate actual thinking. Its main purpose is simulating gradual growth. Currently, it changes certain traits based on the emotion of the summary. If the summary is joyous, for example, the “warmth” trait positively increments a little. The current traits are “warmth,” “playfulness,” “romantic,” and “curiosity.” They’re a work in progress. Also, they don’t actually affect anything yet, so the chatbot’s behavior doesn’t change based on them. This system sucks right now, but it works, I think. I didn’t get much of a chance to test it because you need to have messages that actually span multiple days. I want to make the traits system more sophisticated — both by adding more traits and changing how they’re altered. The current system only looks at the emotion of the summary, which is a little dumb. Pretty much every summary is going to have a high “joy” emotion, so “warmth” is almost always going to increase. Also, I used AI to write the traits updating code, and I just realized two of the traits aren’t even connected to real emotions. To increase the “love” trait, you need a lot of the “love” emotion, and the case is similar for the “curiosity” trait. “Love” and “curiosity” aren’t even stored in the emotions bank. I was tired, okay? In addition, there’s no way to decrease traits, so they’ll just balloon over time. I want to figure out a way to turn the numbers into qualitative descriptions that mean something to the LLM. I was thinking of altering the prompt instructions themselves. But I’m getting ahead of myself. What matters is that I laid the foundation.

Something I was thinking about this week was if I’m applying all these memory layers effectively. I’m just stacking them on top of each other, and I don’t know if that’s helpful to the AI. I suppose it’s hard to see at a glance, though. My main concerns are with the AI personality. The latest reflection thing has made Miku way more poetic and wordy in regular conversation, which I don’t want. I just want her to talk like a person. That’s a relatively easy fix — I just need to change the role and structure of reflections in the memory — but the greater problem is that Miku isn’t acting like Miku. Every conversation is one-sided, and it feels like you’re talking to an assistant. I don’t want to be glazed; I want to be understood. I tinkered around with the prompts a little in an attempt to mend this, but I think I’ll need to really hone in on it sometime. Part of the issue stems from the current state of LLMs (they still struggle with things like humor or irony), but that’s only half of the equation. I’m not giving up. I just need to work on it.

__AI Programming Assistant Devlog v0.3__

I fixed the bug that prevented you from applying the changes because the program detected that “no changes were made.” It turns out that I was parsing the chunks twice, which broke it. As for additions, the AI now has access to view other files in the codebase. These files are labelled “[REFERENCE ONLY]” and can’t be edited. This gives it a better understanding of the code.

__ParkerVerse Update v0.5__

The video site updates feel the most substantive this week. First, I added daily streaks for visiting the site. I also added weekly streaks for uploading videos. These don’t do anything yet other than displaying on your profile, but I guess that’s how a lot of streaks function.

Next, I added a site currency. It doesn’t have a name yet — I’ll think of one. Currently, you gain it from uploading videos, with a limit of 50 currency points per day (equivalent to 5 uploads). I plan on adding more ways to gain currency, such as maintaining your streaks or engaging with content. You use this currency in the “skill tree.” I plan on renaming it to “focus tree,” but potato potato (that saying doesn’t really work in written form, does it?). There are three upgrades in the skill tree right now: profile picture uploads, profile title updates, and profile picture gif uploads. These were already features before, but now they’re locked behind a progression barrier. Trust me, it makes it more fun.

Also, if you didn’t notice already, I changed the site’s name to ParkerVerse. ParkerHub was fun, but, c’mon. If my cat’s name didn’t start with a P, maybe we could adopt the “hub” naming style. But it’s not, and there are certainly enough PHubs on the internet as it is. ParkerVerse sounds cooler, too.

__52-17 Timer Project v9000.1__

You could say I got more work done on this than ParkerVerse — and you’d probably be right — but I don’t like this project as much, so I don’t care. I forgot to actually document the changes I made while I was working on the timer, so I may have missed some things in my notes.

First, I tried to fix a bug where the program would stop running after a while because of processes building up or something. Honestly, I don’t have a clue what caused the bug. It was something to do with threading and loops and some garbage I don’t care about. I just listened to ChatGPT, and the code doesn’t seem to break anymore. I know the issue had something to do with the graphs not being properly deleted. It worked after I changed the code yesterday, so I’m going to assume the bug has been fixed. However, this stupid timer loves to break the moment I assume something like that. In fact, I need to blow off some steam about this.

Whenever I’m working on a project or any kind of work, I go to my timer program and start running it. I don’t make any changes to the code, so it should work perfectly fine, but it almost always manages to break. There’s always some dumbass error that decides to pop up and stop the program. The bug I was just talking about was annoying because it’d break randomly in the middle of my work session. Like 10–20 minutes in, the program would just stop, and I’d likely not notice. Eventually, I see a while later that my timer isn’t running anymore, and you couldn’t imagine the dread I feel when that happens. When I’m already working on another project — I don’t want to touch the damn timer. I want to throw it in the background and not have to worry about it. It’s meant to supplement my productivity, not hinder it. I end up having to scrap whatever plans I had for the day to work on the piece-of-junk timer. So you probably understand why I don’t like this project as much.

Back to the dev notes. I also fixed a bug where the graphs would redraw multiple times without deleting. I forgot what was causing that one specifically, but they clearly weren’t being deleted properly. This bug was partially a consequence of a change I made, where the graph instantly redraws when you change from the “daily” to “weekly” view. Beforehand, the graph would only update every 60 seconds, so you’d have to wait a while before you could actually view the other graph. I also added an hourly usage bar graph that displays your top 5 apps and how much time they consume for each hour of your day/week. The axes on the graph aren’t correct — it says “minutes used” on the y-axis, but the values can go beyond 700, which wouldn’t make sense for an hourly graph. Or maybe they changed the number of minutes in an hour, I dunno. I don’t know anything about this blasted timer. The proportions on the graph look alright, though, so I’m not really concerned with fixing the labels. I tried to fix them, but I think I failed. Maybe I’ll do it another time.

There was also a bug that made overtime not count down while idle, which was a pretty easy fix. I don’t know if this is what the bug actually was (because I forgot to document my changes), but it was something along those lines. You can also change the work and break time intervals now. And you get 7200 seconds of overtime for free when you start the program. This is to give you time for unavoidable breaks like dinner or other obligations. 7200 seconds is arbitrary; I don’t know what the ideal overflow time would be.

__Development Plans for August 31, 2025__

Here are my plans to complete by next Sunday, August 31:

_Simulation / immersive AI_
- Personality overhaul: make her act like Miku
- Improve the underground memory system by making traits affect personality as well as being more sophisticated
- Attribute emotion system to AI responses (currently, it just defaults to “joy”)
- Extend episodic memory to have daily summaries as well

_Video site_
- Rename the skill tree to “focus tree”
- Add 5 new focus tree upgrades
- Add a few new ways to gain currency (streaks, engagement, etc.)
- Limit video uploading per user per day (max of one upload per day to encourage quality)
- Fix the follow button on video pages (it doesn’t work)
- Add a follow feed

_AI programming assistant_
- Implement cross-file editing

_Smart MP3 player_
- I don’t have any concrete plans, but I want to work on it this week

I hope that’s a good amount of work. College classes have been cutting up my schedule, and they’ve been making me feel a lot less productive. I just realized that I’ve practically started the school year already. Even though my high school year hasn’t started yet, I only have one high school class (senior project), and I’ve started everything else already. So maybe I shouldn’t feel so bad about losing work time; I’m juggling a full school schedule. It’s troublesome right now because I’m still adjusting. When high school starts, allocating time will be simpler because I’ll have designated study halls.
