__AI Programming Assistant Devlog v0.1__

Yeah there’s a devlog this week. I said I didn’t have anything planned because of college essays, but I completed them two days early. So I decided to get working on my AI coding assistant.

To use the assistant, you first type instructions into the instructions box (crazy, I know) and tell it what you want it to do. It’ll then determine which file it should update by sending the instructions into another AI. This AI has access to a short summary of each file (also generated automatically by AI, haha) and symbols (like function definitions) for each file. I don’t think the symbols work, though. Originally, I used embedded search, but this didn’t work very often, so I opted to use an LLM because it has a better understanding of context. After that, the instructions and file are sent to the main LLM, where it uses difflib to update the code with the suggested changes. You can also see the specific prompt sent to the AI (this is nice for debugging). You’re then able to preview the code and can choose if you want to apply the changes. If you choose to apply them, your code will be automatically updated. The system also tracks how many input and output tokens you used; right now, I’m using about 10,000 total tokens per prompt, which is a little high, so I’ll have to find ways to minimize it. Currently, the AI is sent the entire file, which isn’t very efficient.

The one big roadblock came on the first day I was working on this project. To reduce the token amount, I tried to implement chunking, which sends code in chunks instead of dumping an entire file. However, for a reason I don’t completely understand, this broke the AI’s ability to update files correctly. It started wiping the entire file and inserting things that shouldn’t be in the code (like commentary and patch format). So I rolled back to an earlier version of the code, and I’ll try to get chunking to work another time.

Here’s what I want to get done for each major project by next Sunday (August 17):

_Simulation / immersive AI_:
    - Incorporate procedural (repeated ideas are retained while others decay) and contextual (info like location and plans) memory
    - Develop a more fleshed out emotion system
    - Use something more sustainable for embedded search (I forgot what I’m using right now, but I know I should change it)

_Video site_:
    - Implement ephemeral storage (videos are deleted a certain amount of time after being uploaded)
    - Add a system to “elect” videos to be saved permanently (every day, whichever video gets the most votes will be saved to a permanent “hall of fame” on the site)
    - Add profile pictures

_AI coding assistant_:
    - Get file symbols to work (if they don’t already)
    - Implement more layers of abstraction for the AI (right now there are two: the codebase layer and the individual file layer)
    - Use chunking or something similar to reduce token amounts
    - If I have the time, create a bugfixing system that sends the traceback to the AI and lets it handle bugs autonomously
    
That’s a whole lot of work, huh? But it’s not too much, and I look forward to making it. This is kind of the last hurrah of the summer; I start dual credit college courses the week after this one, meaning my time will be cut into pieces. It saddens me.
