title: Simulation Devlog v0.12: Dynamic Events; ParkerVerse Update v0.8; Spotify Nicheness Rater v0.2.1
date: September 21, 2025
summary: More locations were added to the AI's memory, and recurring events were now able to be added dynamically. ParkerVerse's focus tree was revamped along with a few new upgrades. The MP3 player received a volume slider and extra GUI information. Unfortunately, while functionally complete, the Spotify analyzer couldn't be deployed publicly due to API restrictions.

I’m exhausted, so you’re just getting the essentials in this devlog.

__Simulation Devlog v0.12: Dynamic Events__

This week, I added a ton more locations, probably triple the previous amount. I also made traits change less quickly. And personality summaries only generate once a day now. Finally, you can add new recurring events, but it only works for weekly events and specific phrases like “I jog every Monday.”

__ParkerVerse Update v0.8__

I’m going to be honest, I didn’t have time to get all the video site stuff done by Saturday, so I spent most of today implementing it. That’s why I’m so tired.

First, I made the video cleanup script run daily. It uses GitHub Actions. I don’t know if it actually runs daily; I haven’t had a chance to check. Also, this script resets user streaks automatically too. I also made profile stickers save in Supabase buckets. Before, they just saved as local files. And on the home page, I removed pagination because it made the site look sketchy, and I made videos stack at three per row instead of just one. The user is also able to disable confetti now.

I added three focus tree unlocks. One is the ability to upload videos; I intend this to be a “tutorial” unlock that everything else branches from. The next is the ability to upload two videos per day; the usual limit is one. And the final one is comment scrolling like NicoNico has. It just takes the comments from a video and periodically makes them scroll across the video player. Come to think of it, I didn’t add a way to disable this. I’ll do that next week.

I also improved the look of the focus tree. It’s now a big set of nodes that you can pan through and zoom in and out of. It looks cool, but the connections between the nodes are broken. I was trying to fix it today, but I spent like an hour and gave up. I’m so tired. I don’t know why I’m tired, either. I guess being sick just messed things up.

__Smart MP3 Player v0.3__

I added a volume slider that smoothly changes the player volume as you slide it. And MP3 author and image information are now displayed.

__Spotify Nicheness Rater v0.2.1__

As I’ve said, I’m tired, so you get to save yourself my rant on Spotify. I might talk about it another time. As I said in my entry a few days ago, I’m not using Spotify to develop anything again. I spent the money needed to push my site out (like $10–12 total), and it wasn’t working for my friend. This is because I was in developer mode. But no worries, I just needed to switch my mode to make it public. Nope. As of May 2025, Spotify made it impossible for solo developers to release public projects with their API. Additionally, you need over 250 thousand monthly active users to even be eligible. They said in some post that this doesn’t affect 99% of developers. They’re lying out of their ass, and they know it. I don’t know how the hell my app is meant to get 250 thousand monthly active users if I need that many users to even make it functional. I’m not going to get 250 thousand people to agree to wait around for Spotify to approve my access. Spotify is a terrible company, but I wouldn’t expect anything more of them. I need to remember to cancel my web host subscription. It’s a little embarrassing that I noticed this problem so late into development, but at least this was a small project. I can slap it on my portfolio, and it looks pretty. I’ll just never make anything related to Spotify again, because they’ve shown that they’ll rip anything from developers’ grasp on a whim.

__Development Plans for September 22, 2025__

Here are my plans to complete by next Monday, September 22:
Write the development plans for September 28, 2025

Yeah, I’m too tired to write them all out right now. Goodnight.

_The next day..._

__Development Plans for September 28, 2025__

Here are my plans to complete by next Sunday, September 28:

_Simulation / immersive AI_
- Instead of making conversations operate via simple back-and-forth messaging, make Miku talk based on how much time has passed (so she’ll give a small response or interjection if a little time has passed, and she’ll expand or change topics if more time has passed — she may also make a comment if you leave for a long time)
- Add a system to dynamically change context length depending on the message (so short messages like “hello” use very little context)
- Switch the responses to use “streaming” (this generates the text as the chatbot is thinking instead of dumping it all at once)

_Video site_
- Fix the focus tree view and make it look better
- Fix the other bugs I noted in the TODO section of my code (I would list them here, but I forgot what they were)
- Improve the GUI
- Add one or more focus tree upgrades

_Spotify nicheness rater_
- Cancel my PythonAnywhere subscription (I was using it to host the site)

Yeah, the Spotify Nicheness Analyzer one isn’t really a developer goal. I’m just putting it there so I don’t forget. The main point of interest this week is the chatbot. I’ve been stagnating for a while on it, but I’ve been thinking about points of improvement, and I’m excited to start working on it this week. I’m less excited to work on the video site, but it’ll be worth it to clean it up and fix some bugs. It’s weird to think that I’m back to the two original projects. I guess school has really eaten away my time. That said, if I do have time, I have quite a few things I could work on. The dreaded clock is one of them.
