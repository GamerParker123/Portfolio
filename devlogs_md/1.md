title: Simulation Devlog 1–5
date: May 23 – June 8, 2025
summary: My first five devlogs. These mark the beginning of my development, starting in Unity.

__Simulation Devlog 1__

I have started work on my simulation idea. At this stage, nothing is permanent, but I think the experience earned is what’s important. I’m building in Unity currently, and that’s certainly going to change as my scale gets larger, but my current hardware limitations force me to use it. Anyway, today I made a capsule player that you can move around and control with a first person camera, and I imported a Miku model. The model doesn’t do anything, but you can look at it. Pretty cool, I think.

I hope I can add to this devlog at least twice a week, especially with summer break coming by. It also breaks up my writing a little more, which I’m always in favor of. I want this journal to include every part of myself. Also, I don’t plan on making these very lengthy, so they shouldn’t get in the way of other entries too much. I look forward to continuing this project.

__Simulation Devlog 2__

Today, I added models for Kasane Teto and Akita Neru to give Miku some company. I also imported an animation for the Macarena dance so they don’t all stand still anymore, and “Triple Baka” plays on loop in the background. I’m just messing around right now. It’s fun, and I’m learning more about using Unity.

__Simulation Devlog 3__

I didn’t add anything to the project today. I’ve spent the last few hours trying to import a Miku avatar that I liked into VRChat (an online VR app where you can talk to others, as the name suggests) to no avail. The one I want doesn’t seem to be publicly available to equip, so I tried downloading models online but couldn’t get them to work in Unity. In the meantime, I’ll keep looking, but it does suck when you keep trying something and just can’t get it to work. I try to look at the bright side of things, though, and by spending all this time trying to figure out how to work around these tools, I’m understanding them better, which will make my future endeavors come along more smoothly. It’s certainly better than spending my day consuming YouTube videos or other mindless content. I’ll probably try to tackle this again in the coming days because, man, does it make me want to pull my hair out. Wanting to do something and knowing it’s possible if I know what I’m doing but not knowing how to do invokes a lasting form of frustration inside of me. I’m afraid I may be rambling now, so I’ll cap off the entry here.

Actually, I lied about ending it there. There’s one thing I want to add that I just thought of. In future devlog entries, I think I’m going to incorporate more about the obstacles I face and my methodology rather than just the final product. That’ll better represent my journey. Plus, self-reflection is good for learning.

__Simulation Devlog 4__

I made a sphere that toggles the animation and music when you click on it. I didn’t have many issues implementing it, so I don’t have much to add here.

__Simulation Devlog 5__

Today is Sunday, June 8. I promised I’d give updates to my simulation today. Importantly, I managed to complete every goal I set.

The first addition I made was the idle animation for Miku. This was pretty straightforward. I had experience importing animations into Unity already, so I searched up one online and was able to get it in with no issue. The only minor problem was that Miku’s rig would slowly lift into the sky between transitioning animations, but all I needed to do to fix that was disable root animation. I also built a rudimentary room around Miku, and I really mean rudimentary. It has a floor, 4 walls, and a ceiling. I gave each their own color, and the floor has a carpet texture because it looked a little too plain without one. Also, I imported a model of a leek to make the room a little less empty. So, now it’s basically complete, right? I’m kidding, but I know Miku loves her leeks.

The most difficult part to implement was the interaction with Miku. I decided to make her fall over when you click on her, so I imported another animation to make that happen. Accomplishing this required a bit of scripting, so I consulted my accredited mentor, ChatGPT, to help me out. The script was pretty easy to compile, but I kept running into the error that the animation trigger wasn’t, well, triggering. However, eventually I realized that it was because the script was attached to the rig, while the collider was a child of the rig, so Unity had no collider to point to in relation to the script. Honestly, I don’t understand the syntax itself a ton, but I used raycasting to reference the collider, and that worked. Now, I had a new issue; the fall animation wasn’t actually making Miku fall, it was just playing the animation while she floated in the air. The reason this was happening is because of something I did at the very start to fix another issue: disabling root animation. By deactivating root animation, the root of the rig was stationary, hence why Miku was staying in the air. So, I turned root animation back on, but that had the consequence of not preserving Miku’s original position. Every time she fell, she’d get lower and lower, eventually sinking below the ground, out of sight. It took me a while to fix this, but all I did was detect when her falling animation ended and reset her position to what it originally was. ChatGPT’s code wasn’t working, but I’m not enough of a moron to give up there, so I made alterations until I got it to work. Now, whenever you click on Miku, she falls over. It’s a little mean, but I have to admit that it’s kind of funny. For the second time today, I’m sorry, Miku, although you’ll have to forgive me because I’m keeping this for the foreseeable future.

I’ll lay out my plans for the coming week(s) tomorrow because I can’t be bothered to do it right now. Too lazy. I need to think about it more, anyway.

_The next day..._

__June 9–15 Devlog Plans__

I pushed this off yesterday, so now it’s on my plate again. I’m only going to plan out the next week of development today because it’s hard to predict where this will go months from now. I’m also still ironing out the time I have to allot to this project.

By June 15, here’s what I want to have implemented:
- The ability to give Miku a leek
- A more fleshed out song list, including a way to select songs
- Three furnishings to the room
That sounds manageable. I also think it’ll improve my understanding of Unity, which is the most important part about the beginning of this project. I may do more than just this in the following weeks, but that depends on how often I’m available.
