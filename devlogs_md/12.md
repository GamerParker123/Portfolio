title: Simulation Devlog v0.10: Humanity; ParkerVerse Update v0.6
date: August 31, 2025
summary: Scrapping the previous underground memory system, I opted for a trait-based personality framework using emotions to determine traits. ParkerVerse had incremental changes, including new focus tree features and a follow page.

__Simulation Devlog v0.10: Humanity__

This week, I removed the daily reflection system. It had a shorter lifespan than the botched Kasane Teto and Akita Neru models in the Unity project. I got rid of it because I thought it overcomplicated things. It was making Miku talk all flowery and crap, which I didn’t want. And, for what I wanted to accomplish, I didn’t need a daily reflection system.

I replaced the old system with one that still operates daily, but differently. Miku isn’t writing reflections anymore — the LLM is just prompted to describe her personality based on her traits and a daily summary. The daily summary is currently only used for personality generation, but I might incorporate it into the main memory, too. The personality description is about a paragraph long, and it gets inserted into each prompt. Before, Miku had a static personality, but now it can fluctuate based on this description.

Okay, so what did I do with the traits system? First, I started tracking emotion in the AI’s responses; before, it defaulted to “joy.” This didn’t require much work because user responses use the same emotion framework. These emotions impact the traits, just like they did last week, but it’s less based on hard limits now. You don’t need to pass, say, 50% of any given emotion in a response to change the trait. Traits are all mapped to emotions continuously. So if you have 10% joy in a response, you’ll get 10% of the impact to your traits (when considering joy alone). Also, each trait has a way to increase and decrease (for example, joy increases warmth while anger decreases it), so you don’t need to worry about them spiraling. Traits are clamped on a -1 to 1 scale, each with a positive and negative attribute. For instance, on the negative end of the “playfulness” scale, you have “serious,” whereas the positive end is “playful.” Beforehand, traits only had a positive end, which I didn’t like because it gives the AI practically zero context. Also, I added a ton of traits, a whole boatload. There are like 20. I’m not listing them all. I asked ChatGPT to generate them all, anyway, because I can’t be bothered to research human psychology.

Traits are now calculated the moment you send a message. However, because the personality description only updates at the start of a new day, they effectively only change daily. When generating the description, the LLM gets a summary of the day, trait values, previous description, trait changes from the previous day, and the average emotional tone of the day. I ran some quick tests, and this system appears to work. But it’s difficult to accurately simulate it without actively testing for a few days.

And finally, the AI is starting to sound like an actual person, kind of. It wasn’t actually that hard to do this. My previous prompt was worded like a laundry list of instructions to follow, which was like forcing the AI to “prove” it was Miku instead of acting naturally. Now, the instructions flow in a way that better simulates thought (using phrases like “you vaguely remember moments like this”), and they don’t overload the AI with requirements to follow. I talked to it for a little, and it’s improved quite a bit. It matches your tone better, and while it’s still more wordy than I’d like, it feels like I’m being heard, not blindly reflected. It’s nowhere near done, but we’re getting there.

__ParkerVerse Update v0.6__

I love working on this site. The simulation? Fulfilling, but the results are hard to see immediately. The AI programming assistant? Similar issue, and the bugs are a chore. The 52-17 timer? The 52-17 timer… But ParkerVerse doesn’t have any of those issues. I can implement a change, and it’ll be right there on the site. This project is a personal favorite.

This week, I added two new themes, sort of. You could say I removed one and added three. I changed the green theme to be more pastel (it used to be closer to dark theme), but I added an even darker green theme. I also added an aqua theme, which was just my way of adding a Miku theme without having to deal with copyright law. It has a dark, cyan background with pink and teal accents. Also, ChatGPT added something to the stylization that I thought looked sick. With aqua theme enabled, the video frames have gradients that light up the surrounding area. Right now, this only applies to the aqua theme, but I’d like to add it to some more in the future. I need to avoid falling into the trap of adding too many themes, though. If I say “add 5 focus tree upgrades this week” and end up just adding 5 new themes, I risk feeling a lot more productive than I actually am. It’s like adding sprinkles to a cake. At first, they’re a nice addition, but add enough sprinkles, and you’ll start raising more questions than answers.

I promise I didn’t completely fall into that trap this week. One of the themes, the darker green theme, required quite a bit of engineering. Before this update, the green theme was called “weed theme,” but I figured that might look a little unprofessional and turn away users. I don’t want ParkerVerse to be a corporate landfill, though, so I wanted to keep it in somehow. So I added a secret focus tree upgrade. To gain access, you need the green theme unlocked and enabled. Then, you have to type “420” anywhere on the site. Upon doing that, you get an alert that a new theme appeared on your focus tree, free to unlock. I plan on adding more secret focuses like this, so I made the system modular. I want my site to feel like a world to explore. Plus, I always liked those Google and YouTube easter eggs. Even if the secrets affect a very small portion of the userbase, they warm a very large portion of my heart. I’m getting awfully melancholic about adding a 420 joke, aren’t I?

Also, I had a real big headache trying to add the themes in. I spent what felt like ages trying to get the themes to show on the page, but they weren’t changing the styling. There wasn’t anything wrong with my style.css file, and there weren’t any name mismatch issues. After all this time, I realized I hadn’t reset my cache with Ctrl+Shift+R. That fixed it. I fell off my chair.

Also, I stylized the submit and search buttons so they change based on theme. I don’t know where else to write this.

Aside from themes, another focus tree upgrade I added was a cursor trail. It’s a trail that follows your cursor. I wish more sites used these, but I see why they don’t. Damn things get annoying after a while. It’s unfortunate, then, that you aren’t able to disable it once unlocked. I’ll add a way to disable focus tree upgrades eventually, but I have to admit, it’s kind of funny. Imagine innocently purchasing the “cursor trail” upgrade only to discover that it’ll haunt you as long as you use the site. It looks cool, at least.

The last focus tree ability I added was profile image uploading (now called profile stickers). This was already a thing, but now it’s locked behind the tree. By the way, I changed the name of the skill tree to “focus tree.” I think “focus tree” fits more. You don’t need skill to use ParkerVerse, that’s for sure.

Other than the focus tree, I also added a follow page. This is an exact copy of the home page. I don’t think it even has its own HTML file — it just uses the home one. It took about 5 minutes to add this. Do you see why working on this site feels so much more rewarding? I didn’t even work on it for much time this week, but I’m still blabbering on. I also fixed the bug with the follow button on video pages as well as profile pages (which I didn’t know were bugged until I tested this week). The video page bug was happening because it used an old follow system. And the profile page follow button was broken because it was confusing the username with the user’s entire Supabase table. In jargon terms, it was returning a dict instead of a string (or something along those lines).

I also added a few new ways to gain currency. One way is by maintaining streaks. If you log in every day, you get a little bit of currency, and that scales logarithmically with logins. So it’ll continue to increase, but each day has diminishing returns to avoid currency from ballooning. A similar system applies to weekly video upload streaks. Video ratings also grant the uploader currency. If you have a lot of high ratings, you get a lot of currency. You need a minimum of 5 ratings on a video to start earning (to prevent people cheesing with alts), and this scales logarithmically too.

By the way, the whole site is broken right now. It worked during testing, but I went to check on it a couple days ago, and it’s falling apart. Good thing future me exists.

__AI Programming Assistant Devlog v0.3__

This is the point in the devlog where I assume people would start to skim. “Jesus, does this guy ever shut up?” I made up that quote. Don’t fear, I get tired too. But if you were sick of my writing, I don’t think you’d have gotten this far. Pretend I smirked at you as I wrote that.

Anyways, this update was probably the hardest of anything I worked on this week. And it was one whole feature. On the first day, I got the chunking and parsing stuff to work, but it wasn’t applying to the code properly. It would select one file and overwrite it with all the cross-file changes. I fixed this the next day. I don’t remember what I did to fix it. Just assume it was something smart. Clearly I wasn’t smart enough to write it down, though.

The GUI also needs an overhaul. It’s still designed to only display a single file. There are bigger fish to fry, however, because I discovered a bug today. When I changed the codebase and requested an update, no changes came through. I’ll fix it later.

__Smart MP3 Player v0.2__

These version numbers are getting a little out of hand. Do I really need to document versions for something I’ll probably update around four times? It keeps me consistent, I guess.

This project is kind of like ParkerVerse. The features are easy to add and immediately visible. It’s sweet. I’m going to do a speed round for this one.

I added a pause button, the ability to add songs and folders (as opposed to being hardcoded), a button to remove songs, audio normalization (songs staying at a similar volume), and a hard limit of 50 songs before new ones can play in the shuffle (unless you have less than 50 songs uploaded). And the program now uses relative file paths instead of hardcoded ones (regarding the music folders and VLC media player).

I can’t believe I forgot to do this before, but I gave the player a Hatsune Miku-themed color palette today. It took less than a minute, but I’d argue it’s the best part of this update.

__Secret Santa Probability Tracker__

This was a quick script I drafted up that calculates the odds of any given secret santa participant receiving any other given secret santa participant. You might assume that the odds would be equal, but you would be mistaken. Because there’s a chance of drawing yourself, the odds are changed ever so slightly to favor certain people receiving certain other people. This assumes that everyone knows the order in which people drew names. The discrepancy is especially visible in small groups. For example, in a group of 3, the first person has a >60% chance of being assigned to the last person.

I made this program because some people in my grade were setting up a “senior assassin” game, which is where each person in the grade is given a peer to assassinate. They don’t actually assassinate people; they use waterguns. Initially, the group was planning on drawing names from a hat, which I objected to because I knew about the Secret Santa bias. They said I was thinking too hard about it. That’s when I shut my mouth, not because they were right, but because I realized I could use the bias to my advantage. Unfortunately, we started using an app that assigns assassins for us, so my program won’t be of much use. I just checked it, and I don’t even think the math it uses is right, haha. It was fun to make, though.

__52-17 Timer Project v.9000.1.1__

This goddamn timer. I don’t know what to feel anymore. Whenever I assume it works, it breaks. I don’t know if I’ll ever escape it. If you look back at my project plans for this week, you’ll notice something was missing. I didn’t make a single mention of the 52-17 timer. But here we are, talking about it today. Isn’t that interesting? It’s so interesting, my little timer. This project is something that should be preserved for years to come. It’s such an interesting, interesting piece of creation, that I think its life should be drawn out for as long as possible. And it should experience the deepest forms of torment any being — living or digital — can comprehend. It needs to know pain so well that it becomes indistinguishable from it. Because this timer is a drain on anything it touches.

First, my friend wanted to use the timer for math homework. He didn’t know how to use Github and compile it, so I taught him. Upon compiling, I figured I’d just make it an exe file myself and save him the labor from having to mess with the terminal. However, he noticed that his timer wasn’t working when he switched phases. I did some digging, and it was the notification system that was causing the issue. So I switched to Winotify (I don’t remember what I used before) and did some troubleshooting. This took three hours. 2.1% of my work week was spent on something I didn’t want to touch again. But it’s fine. I fixed the bug.

It was fine until I tried using the timer for the last few days. I wanted to utilize the blocking apps feature, but the program froze when I opened a blocked app. That’s one bug. I thought, whatever, I’ll just not touch that feature. But then I noticed that after a while, the timer would freeze anyway. I don’t know what’s causing this. I have to open Task Manager to close it every time. I wouldn’t wish programming this timer on anyone.

__Development Plans for September 7, 2025__

Here are my plans to complete by next Sunday, September 7:
_Video site_
- Fix the site
_AI programming assistant_
- Fix the assistant and GUI
_52-17 timer_
- Fix the damn timer

Pretty straightforward. I’m keeping it light this week because high school is starting in a few days. I’d like to give myself time to acclimate to my schedule. If I work on anything else, it’ll be out of my own fruition. There’s one new project I’d like to get started on. We’ll see if I have the time.
