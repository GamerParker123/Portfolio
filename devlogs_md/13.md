title: ParkerVerse Update v0.6.1; Spotify Nicheness Rater v0.1
date: September 7, 2025
summary: With school starting, I mostly focused on maintenance work, fixing bugs across my projects. In the meantime, a new project arose: a Spotify playlist analyzer that determines how niche your music tastes are.

This week was a lighter one, but that was probably the right call. School has been piling up.

__ParkerVerse Update v0.6.1__

I first, well, fixed the site. This time, the issue was that I didn’t check for whether or not the user was logged in. In my testing, I was always viewing through an account, so it all went to crap when I deployed and tried to use it. Because the site was checking for your focus tree progress based on your user, it’d break if you weren’t in the database at all. I added checks for user data, and the bug went away.

I also added some quality-of-life patches because I felt like it. For one, I simplified the focus tree descriptions and made them more consistent (like making theme unlocks have similar phrasing). I also made all videos lock into a 16:9 frame with a constant size. Before, videos would have a different aspect ratio and size on the site based on their initial ratio. And that looked clunky. It took a while for me to implement this — all the code looked like it was working, but the frontend wouldn’t change. And would you believe it again? I forgot to reset the cache. There’s a saying about being fooled twice. I’m definitely not going to be fooled three times, so now I reset the cache after practically any styling change. It’s better to be safe than sorry.

__AI Programming Assistant Devlog v0.4__

I fixed this, too. As a reminder, the issue was that the updated AI code wasn’t being parsed when changing codebases. The issue had something to do with not updating new files and merged files. For context, new files are the code suggestions given by the AI, and merged files are those suggestions being merged with the old files. That error was straightforward to fix once I narrowed it down.

__52-17 Timer Project v.9000.1.1.1__

This timer is my Moby Dick. Or was Moby Dick the sailor? I never read the book.

I worked on it this week, and I fixed one thing. The overtime counter wasn’t working, and it turns out that I removed the code that counted it up and down during work and break time. Oops. That was an easy fix, though. I also fixed the bug that made the program crash when you attempt to open a removed app. I think it had something to do with interrupting the threading loop.

Now the bad part. It still crashes randomly. I thought — I hoped — I fixed it. I thought that maybe the CSV file with all the data was getting too long. When you have the program running for a few hours, the spreadsheet gets really long, which increases the amount of time to read the file. Because it was being read every second, eventually it got jammed up. I improved the efficiency there, and I prayed that it was fixed. Nope. It still crashes with some async threading error. Honestly, I don’t know what the hell that even is. I think it has something to do with the graphs.

I’ll catch you one day, Dick.

__Secret Santa Probability Tracker 2.0__

I thought I was going to abandon this project, but my school’s senior assassin game had some changes. We were planning on using an app that would select assassins for us, which would remove the point of my tracker, but that app sucked. So now we’re back to the hat pull method. Unfortunately, we didn’t do the hat pull in one sitting. My friend has been carrying around a box with everyone’s names in it and asking people to draw from it over the course of a few days. That’s made tracking the order quite annoying. I’ve had to chase down every hat pull and document the order myself. I’ve been successful so far, but I might miss some upcoming pulls. My schedule doesn’t completely align with my friend’s, meaning they might draw names when I’m not at school. That would be unfortunate. Still, I worked on the tracker this week.

First, I fixed the math. I noticed last week that the numbers looked off, and they were. I don’t remember what the issue was. I’m just relying on ChatGPT math. However, I told GPT to fix it, and the numbers look right now. Also, for large groups (10+ people), I now make the program run Monte Carlo simulations instead of running exact calculations. A Monte Carlo simulation essentially runs a statistical analysis over a bunch of possible data points. Right now, it runs 100,000 Secret Santa games and averages the results. It’s not exact because it relies on probability instead of raw math, but the difference is indistinguishable for larger groups.

I also published the project to GitHub. I made a little README for it, too. It’s nice to push some of my stuff out like that. It helps preserve my work, too. If my laptop exploded tomorrow, I’d know that my Secret Santa code is safely saved on GitHub. We wouldn’t want to miss that.

__Spotify Nicheness Rater v0.1__

Usually, my devlog entries put the most interesting stuff first and slow to a crawl near the end. This week is different. If you were paying attention in the last devlog (I understand if you weren’t), I said I had an idea I wanted to work on. That idea was, of course, the Spotify Nicheness Rater.

Two things inspired me to make this. First, Spotify Wrapped is huge. People love seeing their tastes and sharing their results every year. For many, music is a part of your identity. The second inspiration was a trend I’ve seen recently surrounding “nicheness.” My friends have been saying their Instagram feed is “niche,” which means it’s exceptionally rare or unique. I think it stems down to something to do with individuality. Everyone likes to hear about themselves and what makes them special. It’s the reason personality quizzes or political compasses are so huge. Why don’t we have a musical variant?

I will admit — and I discovered this after practically finishing the site — there’s already a sort of solution to what I’ve been talking about. There’s this site called Obscurify that looks at your Spotify account and tells you how “obscure” it is, including some other trends in your listening habits. However, my site looks at playlists rather than entire accounts. And more importantly, I think Obscurify is missing some virality features. There’s a way to share your profile, but it’s at the bottom of your results and you have to copy a link and share it. There’s no easy way to take a screenshot and post to your Instagram or whatnot. I want my site to capitalize on not just the results but the ease of spreadability.

I should probably describe what I did this week. If you hadn’t grasped it already, I made a site that calculates how niche your music taste is. There are three variables that go into the calculation. First: song popularity. Spotify gives each song a popularity from 0–100, so my site just takes the average popularity and rewards playlists with a lower average. If you listen to niche songs, you have a niche taste. What if someone listens to a ton of obscure songs, but they’re all by the same artist? That’s where the second variable, artist diversity, comes in. This was more annoying to implement. I didn’t want to simply count the number of unique artists and divide by the number of total songs because that’d heavily favor small playlists. If you have a 5-song playlist, each of those songs is more likely to have a unique artist than in a 500-song playlist. To offset this bias, I added a multiplier that increases diversity based on the number of songs. It caps at around 100 songs. I wanted to implement something that changes the weight of the songs themselves based on playlist size, but that got too complicated for what it was worth. Besides that, I also added an “evenness” calculator for diversity. It uses logarithms and this thing called Shannon entropy. I don’t really know how the math works, but Shannon entropy calculates how evenly spread a set of values is. This means a playlist with a bunch of evenly spread artists is considered more diverse than one with a ton of unique artists but half the songs are by the same one.

Anyway, the final variable is genre diversity. If you listen to unpopular songs from a variety of artists, that isn’t as niche if it’s all from the same genre. So my code takes the genre labels for each artist (supplied by the Spotify API) and calculates your genre spread. It’s very similar to artist diversity. I wish I could take genre labels by song, and if I made this a year ago, I could. In 2024, Spotify deprecated the feature that let you analyze individual track features. This includes genre. They say it was for security reasons, but let’s be honest: it was for the money. They were giving away a ton of valuable data for free, and in the corporate world, nothing free lasts for long. This also prevented me from implementing what was going to be the fourth variable: track diversity. Spotify assigns a ton of variables to tracks, including tempo, key, and even things like “danceability.” I was going to calculate the standard deviation for each of these values, but I couldn’t access them because the API feature was gone. There were some alternatives that could calculate these for you, but they were paid. I figured it wasn’t worth the hassle, so I scrapped this part of the formula.

I’m sad I couldn’t pull more stats for the site, but it’s not a huge deal. The nicheness score itself doesn’t matter. I don’t need a 100% accurate formula to have a working site. The key is the fanfare. Everything on the site is styled and modern. There’s pop-out displays, glowing buttons, a moving background gradient, and much more. I aimed to make the site as usable and appealing as possible. This deviates from most of my projects, which value functionality over form. But I never cared about functionality for this one. I don’t even use Spotify; I listen to all my songs as MP3s. It’s like a Jew selling Bibles.

I don’t know if it’ll succeed. There’s always a luck factor in virality. But there’s still a formula. Even if the site doesn’t kick off — and let’s be honest, the odds are stacked against me — it only took a few days to make. At worst, this is something pretty and complete that I can slot into my portfolio. If you never hear about this project again, it went nowhere.

Back to the additions, I also made a logo for the site in about 15 minutes. I just took the Spotify logo, colored it all green, and put some made-up bars over it. I just needed something for the webpage’s favicon — the little icon that appears on the site tab. I also added a container on the bottom left of the screen that says “Made by GamerParker123” along with my YouTube profile picture. GamerParker123 is my YouTube username. Yeah, it’s named after my cat. I figured I should plug my socials.

I spent an embarrassingly long amount of time trying to fix the overscroll. On a webpage, you’re able to scroll a bit past the body of the page. It scrolls back up for you, but you can still see outside for a moment. On my site, the region outside the body was a plain white background, which was killing the vibe I was going for. First, I made it match with the background gradient, but that didn’t match with the top of the screen, which had a green header. So I made the overscroll background green, but that didn’t fit with the bottom of the screen. I couldn’t figure out how to make both match for the life of me, so I ended up sticking with the green. It doesn’t fit with the background gradient, but if the user thinks it’s intentional, it looks kind of cool.

Onto the analysis page, my site lets you include multiple playlists. I know some people theme their playlists, so they would be unfairly disadvantaged if the site only factored a single playlist. The maximum amount you can include is 10, and the calculations just treat them all as one big playlist. Upon submitting, you can still see the individual scores. There’s a card for each playlist that displays the image, title, author, and nicheness score. It looks snazzy. The page also displays a color-coded bar graph of every song and their popularity scores. This also looks cool. Finally, there’s a percentile container that shows how much more unique your taste is compared to every other playlist on the site. You also share your nicheness score on Twitter, but it’s very rudimentary. I’m going to add more ways to share.

For testing, I made a script that takes a ton of low-popularity songs off of Spotify and automatically creates a playlist with them compiled. This gave me an extreme example for balancing the score algorithm.

__Development Plans for September 14, 2025__

Here are my plans to complete by next Sunday, September 14:

_52-17 timer_
- Fix the timer (for real this time)

_Spotify nicheness rater_
- Add shareability options
- Deploy the site

_Video site_
- Add 3 new focus tree features (no new themes)
- Add the ability to disable certain unlocks (like the mouse trail)
- Add a better submenu for themes (instead of having to cycle through each one individually)
- Add a designated profile editor (instead of just grouping all edit options to the profile page)

_Simulation / immersive AI_
- Add anniversary or recurring events to the context window (like birthdays or weekday-specific events like Taco Tuesday)
- Create a list of locations for the AI to choose from instead of making everything up on the fly (and maybe include metrics like distance and direction)

I’m not really sure where to take the chatbot next, so the goals are lighter for it this week. It’s practically complete, but it still feels so far away. Hopefully I’ll get some inspiration as I work on it next week.
